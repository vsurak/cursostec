# 1. design thinking

Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. It is most useful to tackle ill-defined or unknown problems and involves five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.

Desirability: Meet People’s Needs
The design thinking process starts by looking at the needs, dreams and behaviors of people—the end users. The team listens with empathy to understand what people want, not what the organization thinks they want or need. The team then thinks about solutions to satisfy these needs from the end user’s point of view.

Feasibility: Be Technologically Possible
Once the team identifies one or more solutions, they determine whether the organization can implement them. In theory, any solution is feasible if the organization has infinite resources and time to develop the solution. However, given the team’s current (or future resources), the team evaluates if the solution is worth pursuing. The team may iterate on the solution to make it more feasible or plan to increase its resources (say, hire more people or acquire specialized machinery).

Viability: Generate Profits
A desirable and technically feasible product isn’t enough. The organization must be able to generate revenues and profits from the solution. The viability lens is essential not only for commercial organizations but also for non-profits. 

## Stage 1: Empathize—Research Users' Needs
The team aims to understand the problem, typically through user research. Empathy is crucial to design thinking because it allows designers to set aside your assumptions about the world and gain insight into users and their needs.

- User Interviews
- Empathy Maps
- User Observation / Shadowing 

## Stage 2: Define—State Users' Needs and Problems
Once the team accumulates the information, they analyze the observations and synthesize them to define the core problems. These definitions are called problem statements. The team may create personas to help keep efforts human-centered.

- Point of View (POV) Statements
- Customer Journey Maps
- "How Might We..." (HMW) Questions

## Stage 3: Ideate—Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas
With the foundation ready, teams gear up to “think outside the box.” They brainstorm alternative ways to view the problem and identify innovative solutions to the problem statement.

- Brainstorming
- Crazy Eights
- SCAMPER

## Stage 4: Prototype—Start to Create Solutions
This is an experimental phase. The aim is to identify the best possible solution for each problem. The team produces inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the product (or specific features found within the product) to investigate the ideas. This may be as simple as paper prototypes.

- Paper Prototyping or Digital Mockups (e.g., in Figma)
- Real sketchy prototype
- Storyboarding

## Stage 5: Test—Try the Solutions Out
The team tests these prototypes with real users to evaluate if they solve the problem. The test might throw up new insights, based on which the team might refine the prototype or even go back to the Define stage to revisit the problem.

- Usability Testing
- A/B Testing
- Feedback Grid (I like, I wish, What if)
