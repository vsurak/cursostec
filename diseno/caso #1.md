## Description
20minCoach is a real-time coaching platform that connects people with experts across multiple fields—such as health, psychology, law, mechanics, programming, cloud services, arts, agriculture, and more—through on-demand 20-minute video sessions. Users can describe their need by text or voice, review available coaches’ profiles, ratings, and specialties, and instantly connect once the coach accepts the request. Coaches manage their availability directly in the app, while ratings influence both their reputation and earnings. The business model is based on flexible packages that allow users to purchase a set number of coaching sessions, making expert guidance affordable, accessible, and time-efficient.

**20minCoach: A Day in the Life of Users and Coaches**

Imagine waking up on a Monday morning and facing a challenge: your car makes a strange sound, and you’re not sure what it means. Instead of spending hours searching online, you open **20minCoach**, an app designed to instantly connect people with professional coaches across dozens of areas—mechanics, psychology, art, law, cloud services, agriculture, and more.

As a **user**, you simply type or record a quick voice note explaining what you need: *“I think my car is making a noise from the engine, can someone help me understand what it could be?”* In seconds, the system searches for available coaches, prioritizing those closest to you. You see a mechanic’s profile: photo, professional background, customer reviews, and areas of expertise. Everything looks good, so you hit *Connect.* The mechanic receives a notification, confirms availability, and a **20-minute video call** starts right away. During this call, you show the noise on camera, describe what you hear, and the mechanic guides you on what to check and whether a repair shop visit is urgent.

The session ends after exactly 20 minutes, giving you focused, personalized advice without overcommitting your time or money. You rate the coach, leaving a short review. That rating directly contributes to the coach’s earnings and reputation within the platform.

From the **coach’s perspective**, the day looks different. Take Maria, a professional painter who uses her mornings to update her profile on 20minCoach, uploading new images of her work and writing about her teaching style. She sets herself as *Available* before starting her day. Later, while having coffee, she receives a notification: someone nearby is looking for help with watercolor techniques. She reviews the request, accepts, and within moments is in a video call. For 20 minutes, she provides guidance, tips, and even small live demonstrations. When the session ends, Maria checks her earnings, notes her updated rating, and toggles her availability off before moving on with her day.

**The Business Model**
20minCoach works with prepaid packages, making access to expert help affordable and flexible. For example:

* *Starter Package*: \$19.99 per month for 2 coaching sessions.
* *Pro Package*: \$59.99 per month for 8 coaching sessions.

This model allows users to plan ahead while giving coaches a consistent flow of opportunities to earn, all within a simple and structured 20-minute framework.


**Class Activity:**

1. Research which AI tool would be most convenient for generating the prototype and that provides access to the source code for further development.

2. Create a paper prototype of the screen for searching a coach and the screen for reviewing the selected coach.

3. Determine the following:
   a) AI provider to generate the prototype
   b) Technology stack to be used for developing the frontend
   c) Security provider for the integration

Present the three points above along with the prototype screens at the end of the class.
