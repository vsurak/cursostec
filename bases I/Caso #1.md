## System Description

**Merkadit** is a system designed to optimize the management of gastronomic and retail markets, where an administrator invests in remodeling a physical space and transforms it into multiple shops or kiosks rented by independent businesses. The platform allows managing the initial investment, ongoing operational expenses, the base rent of each space, and the automatic calculation of sales-based fees according to each tenant‚Äôs contract. This provides the administrator with centralized control over revenues, expenses, and the overall financial performance of the marketplace.

Additionally, Merkadit integrates a **point-of-sale (POS)** module for tenant businesses, where they can load their inventory, record real-time sales, and generate operational reports. This sales data flows directly to the administrator, who gains accurate visibility into revenues and the amount owed in rents and fees. With monthly settlement cycles configurable per tenant based on their contract start date, the system ensures transparency, efficiency, and streamlined financial management for both the administrator and the participating businesses.
